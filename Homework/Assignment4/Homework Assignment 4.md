**Homework Assignment 4**

**Due on July 24, 2020**

 

1. You have data on viral load for the first few weeks of infection for a certain infectious disease. An antiviral treatment “Titexatine” has been effective in other similar viral diseases before. Some of these patients were given this treatment, and some received a placebo.

Perform an appropriate linear model analysis to investigate if Titexatine changes viral load over the first few weeks. The data are at the file “Viral Load.csv” at the Folder “Datasets” under the “Files” Section. 7

 

2. You are investigating comparative effectiveness of two interventions that are designed to facilitate physical activity in older women who were diagnosed with a certain degenerative disease. The women were divided into two Groups: A & B; each group received one of the interventions. You have the data on weekly physical activity levels for first few years.

Perform an appropriate linear model analysis to investigate if the interventions are differentially changing the physical activity levels. The data are at the file “AvgWeeklyPA.csv” at the Folder “Datasets” under the “Files” Section. 8





You need to upload the following (in Canvas) in a single file:

1. Your codes.
2. Output.
3. A description (including the linear model equation) of the model you created, and why you created this particular model.
4. A description of the analyses you have performer, and why you performed them.
