**Homework Assignment 3**

**Due on July 8, 2020** 

1. You have data on tumor volume (cm3) for a newly classified prostate cancer. The tumors have been detected at an early stage. (7)

Perform a repeated measure ANOVA-based analysis to investigate if the tumor volume is changing over time; also investigate if there is any evidence of polynomial trend in tumor volume change. The data are at the file “TVolume.csv” at the Folder “Datasets” under the “Files” Section.

2. A novel ghrelin increasing treatment is being tested in patients with abnormally low serum ghrelin. The patients were divided into two groups; one group received the treatment for four days, and the other received placebo. They were observed for the four days, and their serum ghrelin levels (pmol/liter) were recorded. (8)

Perform a repeated measure ANOVA to test if the treatment is efficacious. The data are at the file “Ghrelin3.csv” at the Folder “Datasets” under the “Files” Section.



You need to upload the following (in Canvas) in a single file:

1. Your codes.
2. Output.
3. A description (including the linear model equation) of the model you created, and why you created this particular model.
4. A description of the analyses you have performer, and why you performed them.
5. Your conclusions.
