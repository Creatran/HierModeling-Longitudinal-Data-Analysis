1. Some early stage pancreatic cancer patients went through one of two early treatment procedures: Whipple Procedure or Distal Pancreatectomy. The patients were kept under monthly surveillance for further progression of the disease. If the disease progressed, the time between the treatment and progression was recorded as the follow up time. Moreover, there are also data on each patient’s age at treatment, and the cancer center where the procedure was performed.

Based on the data, perform an appropriate analysis to understand variables associated with progression. The data are at the file progression.csv at the Folder “Datasets” under the “Files” Section.
