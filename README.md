# Hierachical Modeling and Longitudinal Data Analysis
This file contains the coursework of HierModeling & Longitudinal Data analysis, taught by Prof. Aridam RoyChoudhury.

I learned and got hands-on experience about **Mixed Effect Models**, **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling**, and **Longitudinal Data Analysis** through out the study.
