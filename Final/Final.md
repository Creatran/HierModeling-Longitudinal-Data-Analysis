Project 1: 

You are studying a rare tumor by using mice as a model organism. Each mouse was exposed to a carcinogen. Those that developed the tumor were followed for four equidistant time points.

In order to identify the factors associated with tumor growth, you have recorded the baseline age and the baseline L Index. Additionally, ghrelin level, which is hypothesized to have an effect in the growth rate, was recorded in each time point.

Using the data, investigate if ghrelin, baseline age and baseline L Index have an effect on tumor growth.

The data are at the file “MiceTumorP.csv” at the Folder “Longitudinal-Data” under the Folder “Datasets” under the “Files” Section.

Project 2:

You are comparing two treatments for treating anxiety attacks in anxiety disorder patients. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Each group received one of the treatments as they start experiencing an anxiety attack.

They were observed for four equidistant time points, and they were asked to rate (in a scale of 1-5) their anxiety level at each time point. (The first time point is the baseline.) A newly discover biomarker, HLM4, is also deemed to influence the anxiety level, and needs to be taken into account.

Perform an appropriate analysis to investigate if the two treatments have significantly different effects in changing the anxiety level over time.

The data are at the file “AnxietyRating.csv” at the Folder “Longitudinal-Data” under the Folder “Datasets” under the “Files” Section.

You need to upload the following (in Canvas) in a single file:

1. Your codes.
2. Output.
3. A description (including the linear model equation) of the model you created, and why you created this particular model.
4. A description of the analyses you have performer, and why you performed them.
5. Your conclusions.
